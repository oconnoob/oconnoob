Here are some projects / articles you might be interested in:

- ### [MinImagen - A Minimal Imagen Text-to-Image Implementation](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/build-your-own-imagen-text-to-image-model/)
    - MinImagen is a project intended to understand how State-of-the-Art text-to-image models like Imagen and DALL-E 2 work
    - Check out these resources to learn more:
        - [Build Your Own Imagen Text-to-Image Model](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/build-your-own-imagen-text-to-image-model/) (explanatory article)
        - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/MinImagen)
        - [Documentation](https://assemblyai-examples.github.io/MinImagen/index.html)
        - [PyPi Package](https://pypi.org/project/minimagen/)

- ### [How DALL-E 2 Actually Works](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-dall-e-2-actually-works/)
    - This article explains how the DALL-E 2 text-to-image model works under the hood
    - It includes explanations at several levels and is intended for anyone who wants to learn more about Deep Learning / DALL-E 2!

- ### [Introduction to Diffusion Models for Machine Learning](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/diffusion-models-for-machine-learning-introduction/)
    - Both Imagen and DALL-E 2 rely on a relatively recent Deep Learning approach called Diffusion Models
    - This article provides you with everything you need to know to understand how Diffusion Models work

- ### [Why You Should (or Shouldn't) Be Using JAX in 2022](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/why-you-should-or-shouldnt-be-using-jax-in-2022/)
    - JAX is an interesting project from Google which is essentially AutoGrad + NumPy on accelerators
    - JAX is growing in popularity in the ML community, but it follows a different paradigm than [PyTorch or TensorFlow](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-in-2022/)
    - Check out this article to see if JAX is right for you

- ### [Differentiable Programming - A Simple Introduction](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/differentiable-programming-a-simple-introduction/)
    - Differentiable Programming is a relative neologism that is often conflated with Machine Learning
    - Check out this article to learn what Differentiable Programming actually is
